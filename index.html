			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<!-- A sub-heading with a paragraph with that describes your career goals -->
			<h3>Career Goals</h3>
				<p>
					I want to improve my UI/UX skills and hopefully get a job in design. It is important to understand the fundamentals and build a strong foundation of knowledge in order to get anywhere. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Originally, I wanted to work in the tech industry, but I lacked the experience to break through.
				</p>
			<!-- A sub-heading with a paragraph that describes your knowledge of web design up to this point -->
			<h3>Web Design Knowledge</h3>
				<p>
					Currently, my knowledge covers the basics of HTML and CSS. I also have taken many classes related to illustration, ux design, product design, and more. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One project that I am particularly proud of is a conceptual app and website for a YouTube channel called "<a href="https://chantelgee.wordpress.com/2024/01/26/my-current-level-of-design-01-26-24/">Kurzgesagt</a>". 
				</p>
			<!-- A sub-heading with a paragraph that describes what new things you hope to learn -->
			<h3>What I Hope to Learn</h3>
				<p>
					I hope I learn more about web design and create something worthy of putting into a portfolio. Many jobs ask for years of experience, but I am hoping that my future skills will be enough to prove that I deserve a chance.
