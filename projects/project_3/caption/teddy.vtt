00:00:01.542 --> 00:00:04.120
There is something wrong with Teddy.

1
00:00:04.203--> 00:00:05.208
Don't worry, Teddy.

2
00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.320
The doctor's going
to find out what is wrong.

3
00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.125
Count down from 10 now, Teddy.

4
00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:14.720
You won't make it to one because
the doctor is putting you to sleep.

5
00:00:14.803 --> 00:00:19.600
Now the doctor can begin his operation,
and Teddy will not feel a thing.

6
00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:21.920
Now Teddy is on drugs.

7
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.708
The doctor cuts into Teddy's The doctor cuts into Teddy's
flesh with his medical instrument.flesh with his medical instrument.

8
00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:30.320
Look, there is Teddy's bonbon layer,
which makes him sweet.

9
00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:33.720
The doctor takes a closer look at Teddy's bonbons.

10
00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:36.125
That isn't a healthy bonbon, Teddy.

11
00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.958
Here is what a healthy bonbon looks like.

12
00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.708
The doctor removes the bad bonbons.

13
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.760
Now let's look inside Teddy's play pouch.

14
00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:47.240
The doctor says, What a mess.

15
00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:48.542
More sprinkles, please.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.625
Teddy sprinkles.
Now Teddy can play again.

17
00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:55.208
But a good doctor looks deeper than that.

18
00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:58.000
Oh, that is a good sign.

19
00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.480
Teddy's crotch unicorn is healthy.

20
00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:03.080
That means his imagination is healthy.

21
00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.880
What a good sign, Teddy.

22
00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:07.000
Let's look at his kidney now.

23
00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.375
The kidney is what gives Teddy patience.

24
00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.750
With kids. Look at Teddy's kidney crayons.

25
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.600
They have gangrene.

26
00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.583
The doctor puts in nice
red healthy crayons.

27
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.167
You won't hate the children now, Teddy.

28
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840
What is wrong with Teddy's courage?

29
00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:25.917
The doctor looks inside 
Teddy's courage sac.

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.240
What has happened?

31
00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:29.042
What has the doctor discovered?

32
00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:33.583
Oh, Look, Teddy is riddled with fear.
He is afraid.

33
00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:36.667
Look at what fear does
to your courage sac.

34
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.000
The fear is removed and the doctor
replaces it with curiosity.

35
00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:43.625
The curiosity will help Teddy's courage.

36
00:01:43.708 --> 00:01:47.292
Now the doctor must explore Teddy's heart.

37
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.333
That is where his love comes from.

38
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.720
Look how big it is.

39
00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:53.917
Look how much love Teddy has.

40
00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:56.333
What has gone wrong?

41
00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:58.708
That's it. That is what happened.

42
00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:01.000
Teddy loved a bad boy.

43
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.042
What did the bad boy do, Teddy?

44
00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:07.375
Oh, Teddy. The bad boy
broke Teddy's heart's heart.

45
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:10.250
Don't worry, the doctor
will give you a new one.

46
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:14.680
And look, here is a new
child for you to love.

47
00:02:14.763 --> 00:02:16.083
I think we've done it.

48
00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:19.040
It's time to seal Teddy back up.

49
00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:23.083
Just look at the doctor putting Teddy back together again.

50
00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:28.320
The operation is complete,
and soon Teddy will be all better again.

51
00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:31.400
Good night, Teddy.
I hope you get well soon.
